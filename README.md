# JekHELP

`jekhelp` is a command line tool that helps resizing pictures and creating picture gallery files for blogs and websites built with Jekyll.

## Setup

* Clone the repo and `cd` into it
* Install with `pip install .`

## Usage

`jekhelp --help` and `jekhelp thumbs --help` should reveal all possibilities.

Please open an issue in case the displayd online help is not clear enough. Thank you!

## Notes

There are some older versions of above tool, written purely in bash-compatible code. I don't use them anymore but left them here for reference.

* `jekallery.sh` generates jekyll collection files (.md) for a photo gallery
* `thumbs.sh` generates smaller version of pictures that can be used for the jekyll gallery
